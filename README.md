# Emoprint

***The most uesless Python library ever* -- Cheuk**

Emoprint let you have more fun with your buildin print function by adding a random emoji to whatever you are printing!

## Installation 

You sure want the most unless Python library? Okay, wish granted! Just simply install it with pip:

`python -m pip install emoprint`

## Example usage

Just import `print` from emoprint to override the wonderful buildin print that the Python gave you (Why are you doing that seriously?)

`from emoprint import print`
