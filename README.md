# Emoprint 🤠

**The most uesless Python library ever* -- Cheuk**

Emoprint let you have more fun with your buildin print function by adding a random emoji to whatever you are printing! 👍🏻

## Installation

You sure want the most unless Python library? Okay, wish granted 🥳 Just simply install it with pip:

`python -m pip install emoprint`

## Example usage

If you want to randomly add an emoji at the end of your print. Just import `rand_print` from emoprint to override the wonderful buildin print that the Python gave you (Why are you doing that seriously? 😅)

`from emoprint import rand_print as print`

If you fancy something more sophisticated and use nlp to pick the emoji for you (not guarantee a good pick) then import `nlp_print` instead:

`from emoprint import nlp_print as print`
